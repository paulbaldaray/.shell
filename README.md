# Dotfiles

These are my core dotfiles that I use on my linux builds.

## mksymlinks

This is the command that I use to setup all the symlinks to the git managed
files in this repository.

## profile

These hold environment variables that I want share across all shells.

## vimrc

Since I use neovim now, I've greatly minimized the size of my vimrc for
portability, which is really the only advantage that vim has over neovim.
