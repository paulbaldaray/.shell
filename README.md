# Dotfiles

These are my shell dot files that I use on my linux builds. The dot files in my
home directory are managed throught symbolic links.

## mksymlinks

This is the command that I use to setup all the symlinks to the git managed
files in this repository.

## profile

These hold environment variables that I want share across all shells.

## vimrc

Since I use neovim now, I've greatly minimized the size of my vimrc for
portability, which is really the only advantage that vim has over neovim.
